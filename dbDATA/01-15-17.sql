Considering the nature or mode of payment, lack of manpower, geographical locations, and number of the beneficiaries targeted, the Philippine Postal Corporation took almost two (2) months in the distribution of stipend for the 1st quarter 2016 and more or less three (3) months to complete the liquidation reports. Hence, the delayed implementation. Due to the long waiting period to distribute the stipend thru this mode of payment, there are beneficiaries who already died before the payout date. DSWD Memorandum Circular No. 17 series of 2015 entitled, Amendment to the Provisions in the Guidelines on the Implementation of Social Pension for Indigent Senior Citizens, states that \"in case the beneficiary died during the 1st month of the quarter before the scheduled payout, the full amount of the unclaimed stipend shall be given to the replacement beneficiary\".
